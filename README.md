downloads the picture of the day and sets it as the wallpaper [Windows]


This script helps to download the picture of the day from NASA website and sets it as the wallpaper.  
I have also added an exe file \[in dist folder\] which helps to run the script without installing python on your machine.  
Please note this script runs only in 64 bit windows 7.
